# A Multi-response linear regression estimation based on low-rank pre-smoothing

## Description

We establish theoretical results on the performance of the proposed methodology, and quantify its benefit empirically in a number of simulated experiments. We also demonstrate our proposed low-rank pre-smoothing technique on real data arising from the environmental sciences.
